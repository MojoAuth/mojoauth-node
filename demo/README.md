# To run the demo
First generate your api-key and secret from the mojoauth website, by creating a project.

**Note**
```
    Since, mojoauth looks for a hosted website, you can expose http://localhots:3000 with ngrok.
    ngrok is an application to expose local port to the internet.
```
Run the following command to install necessary packages
```
npm install
```
Replace the keys and run the server using
```
    node demo/server.js
```
You can now access the example in the browser of your choice by going to **http://localhost:3000**
